\r
My team recently experimented with restructuring our calendar to enhance collaboration while reducing the damage that meetings inflict on productivity velocity.\r
\r
## The Problem\r
\r
We identified that scattered meetings throughout the day were fragmenting our work time and making it difficult to achieve deep focus. Context switching was killing our productivity, and it was time to do something about it.\r
\r
## Key Questions We Asked\r
\r
When approaching this calendar refactor, we focused on two fundamental questions:\r
\r
1. **What constitutes an ideal calendar for the team?**\r
2. **How can meetings be consolidated to create extended uninterrupted work blocks?**\r
\r
## Our New Schedule Structure\r
\r
After careful consideration and team discussion, we landed on this structure:\r
\r
### Daily Standup (10:30 AM)\r
Quick daily alignment to ensure everyone is on the same page and can identify any blockers early.\r
\r
### Collaborative Block (11 AM – 3 PM)\r
This is the heart of our new approach. We dedicate this entire 4-hour block to **ensemble programming** (also known as mob programming). This protected time allows the team to:\r
- Work together on complex problems\r
- Share knowledge in real-time\r
- Make better decisions through collective intelligence\r
- Build shared understanding of the codebase\r
\r
### Multipurpose Block (3 PM – 4 PM)\r
This flexible hour serves multiple needs:\r
- Sprint refinement\r
- Sprint planning\r
- Asynchronous work and updates\r
- Technical discussions\r
- Team retrospectives\r

\r
## The Benefits\r
\r
By consolidating our meetings and creating large blocks of uninterrupted time, we've seen:\r
\r
- **Reduced context switching** – No more hopping between meetings and code\r
- **Better collaboration** – Extended ensemble sessions build team cohesion\r
- **Protected focus time** – Teams know when they can dive deep\r
- **Predictable schedule** – Everyone knows what to expect each day\r
\r
## Try It Yourself\r
\r
If your team is struggling with a fragmented schedule, I encourage you to try a similar approach. Start by:\r
\r
1. Mapping out all your current meetings\r
2. Identifying which meetings can be consolidated\r
3. Creating blocks of protected collaboration time\r
4. Experimenting and iterating based on team feedback\r
\r
Remember: Your calendar is a tool, not a constraint. Don't be afraid to refactor it just like you would refactor your code!\r

## Discussion\r
\r
What does your team's ideal calendar look like? Have you experimented with time blocking or ensemble programming? I'd love to hear about your experiences in the comments!\r
