**The Runaway Driver** is a common dysfunction in mob programming: when the person at the keyboard ignores the navigator's guidance and implements their own ideas without communication.\r
\r
This disrupts trust and collaborative decision-making. Here's how to address it:\r
\r
## For Navigators\r
\r
- Time-box research when you need more context\r
- Provide honest, respectful feedback\r
- Suggest parking ideas for later review\r
- Shorten timers to maintain tight collaboration\r
\r
## For Drivers\r
\r
- Repeat back what you hear to confirm direction\r
- Respect navigator autonomy even when you disagree\r
- Voice concerns rather than silently implementing your own approach\r
\r
## For Collaborators\r
\r
- Act as a gentle referee when roles blur\r
- Reinforce working agreements\r
- Help realign when the process breaks down\r
\r
The key is maintaining open communication and respecting the roles. When everyone stays aligned with the process, mob programming creates better code and stronger teams.\r
