Instead of waiting weeks for formal retrospectives, run 10–15 minute mini retros right after your sprint ceremonies: Planning, Refinement, Daily Scrums, or Sprint Reviews.\r
\r
## Why Mini Retros Work\r
\r
**Immediate feedback** - Capture insights while they're fresh\r
**Continuous improvement** - Small adjustments accumulate over time\r
**Higher participation** - Real-time course corrections without the wait\r
\r
## Simple Structure\r
\r
1. Allocate 10-15 minutes\r
2. Ask reflection questions:\r
   - Did we achieve our goals?\r
   - What worked well?\r
   - What could improve?\r
3. Keep it informal\r
4. Identify one actionable outcome\r
\r
Consider trying Liberating Structures techniques to enhance creativity and engagement during these sessions.\r
\r
Give Mini Retros a shot at your next meeting. You'll be surprised how regular, bite-sized reflections can spark meaningful growth.\r
