My team recently experimented with restructuring our calendar to enhance collaboration while reducing the damage that meetings inflict on productivity velocity.\r
\r
We identified that scattered meetings throughout the day were fragmenting our productivity. So we asked ourselves:\r
\r
**What constitutes an ideal calendar for the team?**\r
\r
**How can meetings be consolidated to create extended uninterrupted work blocks?**\r
\r
Here's what we landed on:\r
\r

\r
## Our Schedule\r
\r
**10:30 AM Standup** - Quick daily alignment\r
\r
**11 AM–3 PM Collaborative Block** - Dedicated to ensemble programming, creating protected time for deep work and collective problem-solving\r
\r
**3–4 PM Multipurpose Block** - For refinement, planning, async updates, and discussions\r
\r
If your team is struggling with a fragmented schedule, try a similar approach. Consolidate meetings, create large blocks of uninterrupted time, and watch your productivity improve.\r
