When doing mob programming, I recommend running brief retrospectives—5-16 minute mini-retros—when team members need to leave or near the end of the workday.\r
\r
## Questions to Ask\r
\r
**Social:**\r
- Did everyone feel heard?\r
- Were we switching roles effectively?\r
- Was our communication clear?\r
\r
**Technical:**\r
- Were our timer intervals effective?\r
- Did we get stuck on something avoidable?\r
- Any experiments to try next?\r
\r
Keep it light, easy-going, and fun—no red tape, no over-complication. Just a quick, honest check-in to adjust, experiment, and keep improving.\r
\r
Frequent small adjustments = better code, stronger team dynamics, smoother workflows.\r
