Just like code smells signal problems in your codebase, collaboration smells warn you that your team dynamics need attention.\r
\r
## Warning Signs of Poor Collaboration\r
\r
- One person holds all the knowledge (big silo)\r
- Meetings are silent—only one voice dominates\r
- Code reviews take days or weeks\r
- Massive pull requests that take forever to merge\r
- Work halts when key people are absent\r
- "Not my job" attitudes\r
- Knowledge hoarding\r
- Isolated individual work with minimal interaction\r
- Fear of asking questions\r
- Feedback is rare or harsh\r
\r
## The Solution\r
\r
Ensembling/mobbing, pairing, and real-time teamwork break down silos. You solve problems together, share knowledge effortlessly, and build a team where everyone can contribute meaningfully.\r
\r
When you spot these smells, don't ignore them. Address them through better collaboration practices.\r
