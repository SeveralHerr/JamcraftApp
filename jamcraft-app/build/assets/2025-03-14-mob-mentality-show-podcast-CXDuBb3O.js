Thrilled to share that I recorded my first-ever podcast episode with **The Mob Mentality Show**!\r
\r
It was incredibly rewarding to connect with passionate professionals in the mobbing community and discuss how these collaboration techniques apply to game development.\r
\r
## Topics We Covered\r
\r
- Game jam fundamentals and technologies\r
- Mob programming methodologies (solo dev → swarm → mob progression)\r
- Cross-disciplinary collaboration benefits\r
- Integration with streaming platforms (Twitch, Discord)\r
- Code quality practices and design patterns in game development\r
- Public versus private development approaches\r
- Onboarding strategies for new developers\r
\r
The episode dives deep into how mob programming can transform not just traditional software development, but also creative fields like game development and game jams.\r
\r
Stay tuned for the episode release!\r
