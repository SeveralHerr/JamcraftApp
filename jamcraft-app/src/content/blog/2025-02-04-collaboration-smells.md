Just like code smells signal problems in your codebase, collaboration smells warn you that your team dynamics need attention.

## Warning Signs of Poor Collaboration

- One person holds all the knowledge (big silo)
- Meetings are silent—only one voice dominates
- Code reviews take days or weeks
- Massive pull requests that take forever to merge
- Work halts when key people are absent
- "Not my job" attitudes
- Knowledge hoarding
- Isolated individual work with minimal interaction
- Fear of asking questions
- Feedback is rare or harsh

## The Solution

Ensembling/mobbing, pairing, and real-time teamwork break down silos. You solve problems together, share knowledge effortlessly, and build a team where everyone can contribute meaningfully.

When you spot these smells, don't ignore them. Address them through better collaboration practices.
