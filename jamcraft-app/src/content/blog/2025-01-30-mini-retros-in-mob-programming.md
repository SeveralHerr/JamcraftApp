When doing mob programming, I recommend running brief retrospectives—5-16 minute mini-retros—when team members need to leave or near the end of the workday.

## Questions to Ask

**Social:**
- Did everyone feel heard?
- Were we switching roles effectively?
- Was our communication clear?

**Technical:**
- Were our timer intervals effective?
- Did we get stuck on something avoidable?
- Any experiments to try next?

Keep it light, easy-going, and fun—no red tape, no over-complication. Just a quick, honest check-in to adjust, experiment, and keep improving.

Frequent small adjustments = better code, stronger team dynamics, smoother workflows.
