Instead of waiting weeks for formal retrospectives, run 10–15 minute mini retros right after your sprint ceremonies: Planning, Refinement, Daily Scrums, or Sprint Reviews.

## Why Mini Retros Work

**Immediate feedback** - Capture insights while they're fresh
**Continuous improvement** - Small adjustments accumulate over time
**Higher participation** - Real-time course corrections without the wait

## Simple Structure

1. Allocate 10-15 minutes
2. Ask reflection questions:
   - Did we achieve our goals?
   - What worked well?
   - What could improve?
3. Keep it informal
4. Identify one actionable outcome

Consider trying Liberating Structures techniques to enhance creativity and engagement during these sessions.

Give Mini Retros a shot at your next meeting. You'll be surprised how regular, bite-sized reflections can spark meaningful growth.
