Welcome to the Jamcraft blog! This is a starter post to show the format for posts stored as Markdown in `src/content/blog/`.

You can write content here using standard Markdown. Use frontmatter keys `title`, `date`, `slug`, and `tags`.

## Example

This is a second-level heading.

- Use images with relative paths or absolute URLs.
- Keep content reasonably sized (avoid embedding huge images directly).

> Tip: When creating new posts, name files like `YYYY-MM-DD-your-slug.md` for easy ordering and management.
