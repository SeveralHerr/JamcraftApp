  title: "Full Stack Engineer",
  bio: "I’m a Full Stack Engineer who builds scalable, resilient systems that balance technical excellence with human-centered collaboration. At Flexion Inc., I’ve helped modernize critical CDC and state agency applications—delivering secure, cloud-native adjudication and data exchange systems—while co-leading a mob programming squad that fosters shared ownership, transparency, and higher team effectiveness. I explore how AI can enhance software practices and learning, from prompt-engineering context files to AI-assisted retrospectives, treating AI as a creative collaborator. My toolkit spans Go, C#, React, Azure, Terraform, Java, AWS, GCP, and CI/CD automation, grounded in TDD, pair/mob programming, and continuous improvement. Outside of enterprise work, I design games in Godot 4 to explore procedural generation and AI systems that inspire creative, real-world innovation. Curiosity, collaboration, and craft drive me to help teams grow stronger together while delivering meaningful, high-quality software.",
