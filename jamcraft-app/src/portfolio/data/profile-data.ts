  bio: "I’m a Full Stack Engineer who builds scalable, resilient systems with a focus on collaboration and continuous improvement. At Flexion Inc., I’ve helped modernize CDC and state agency applications and co-lead a mob programming squad that boosts team ownership and effectiveness. I explore AI as a creative collaborator to enhance software practices, drawing on a toolkit that includes Go, C#, React, Azure, Terraform, and CI/CD automation. Outside of work, I design games in Godot 4 to explore procedural generation and AI systems—fueling the same curiosity and creativity that drive my professional craft.",
